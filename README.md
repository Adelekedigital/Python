<h1>Welcome to My Python Playground 🐍</h1>

This is my personal space for all things Python. From CS50 assignments to self imposed coding challenges, you’ll find a mix of practical projects and experiments in one place.

I am currently looking for my next hands on project to put all my learning into practice. Something meaningful, challenging, and fun. If you have ideas or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.

Dive in and enjoy the code!
